"""
We use dictionaries in all our Python programs. If not directly in our code, then indirectly because the dict type is a 
fundamental part of Python’s implementation. Class and instance attributes, module namespaces, and function keyword 
arguments are some of the core Python constructs represented by dictionaries in memory. The __builtins__.__dict__ stores
all built-in types, objects, and functions.
